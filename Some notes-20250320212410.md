# Some notes

EME (Economy Middle East) currently has around 30k organic traffic and aims to get 1 million organic traffic

  

Content

  

1. On a case study for a news article about [Dubai Land Department launches pilot phase of Real Estate Tokenization Project](https://economymiddleeast.com/news/dubai-land-department-launches-pilot-phase-of-real-estate-tokenization-project/), EME is fastest to publish news article about it but later drowned by other news sites and most recently by crypto news sites. Suggest to have the Real Estate Tokenization Project at the first place like "Real Estate Tokenization Project pilot phase launched by Dubai Land Department"
2. Should have test different headline on structured data for example instead of just ranking for "dubai land department" which has 150 avg monthly volume, to also focus on "dubai real eastate news" which has 1.6k search volume to optimize its appearance on top stories. So on structured data title it can try "Dubai Real Estate Welcomes It's First Tokenization Project". Note that, a news article can have 5 different SEO-relevant headlines.
3. Looking at last year's traffic spikes, EME ranked for seasonal holiday articles from eid fitr to eid adha. This year's articles doesn't seem to get traffic and needs to be optimized for topic clusters: [https://economymiddleeast.com/news/eid-al-fitr-holiday-dubai-government-human-resources-department-announces-official-dates/](https://economymiddleeast.com/news/eid-al-fitr-holiday-dubai-government-human-resources-department-announces-official-dates/), [https://economymiddleeast.com/news/eid-al-fitr-2025-shawwal-crescent-unlikely-to-be-visible-on-march-29-in-the-arab-world/](https://economymiddleeast.com/news/eid-al-fitr-2025-shawwal-crescent-unlikely-to-be-visible-on-march-29-in-the-arab-world/). Note: Although these are not economic articles but it does brought in huge traffic which enhances EME's search visibility for economic/business articles later on.
4. Can also implement live article with LiveBlogPosting schema markup for updates on the eid fitr leading up to the season end of this month

  

User experience

  

1. Page speed for article pages can be improved - competitors such as Khaleej Times uses AMP so highly suggest to use AMP as speed is key ranking factor for mobile
2. Schema markup for NewsMediaOrganization and LocalBusiness can be added.
3. Breadcrumb links schema markup can be added to enhance the appearance

  

EEAT

  

1. Author profile need to be optimized and the author byline not even being linked on article page
2. Regional coverage enhancement UAE: Dubai Financial Market updates, Saudi: Vision 2030 updates
3. Develop regional expert network which is important with the author profiles. Eg. Elias Al Helou is expert for Bahrain news
4. Sector Authority Development: **Banking & Finance** (Daily market updates, Banking sector analysis, Financial regulation coverage, Investment trends), **Energy** (Oil market analysis, Renewable energy developments, Energy policy updates, Market forecasts), **Real Estate** (Property market trends, Development project updates, Investment opportunities, Market analysis)
5. An idea to rank on the gold price news which is long shot but can try is using LiveBlogPosting schema markup so that the breaking news of its prices can be visible on the top stories all the time - although we might need frequent updates

  

Technical

  

1. The H2,H1,H3 are all over the place has to be fixed
2. Not sure having the multilingual on subfolder [https://economymiddleeast.com/ar/](https://economymiddleeast.com/ar/) is the best for news site that primarily focuses on English despite proper hreflangs. Should it move to [ar.economymiddleast.com](http://ar.economymiddleast.com) instead?

  

Newsletter & Push notification Strategy

  

1. Currently when user on mobile they only see the subscribe button on the top right corner and the subscription box which is on the footer. Suggest to move the subscription box at the end of article to improve acquisition with personalized copy based on the section. For example if the article is about "gold news" then the copy can be Get the latest Gold News on your inbox daily
2. Suggest to use Sign In with Google prompt which can appear automatically when users lands to the page to automatically get their email addresses. Example below from [Detik.com](http://Detik.com):![](https://t9002166976.p.clickup-attachments.com/t9002166976/7878f8bd-428b-42a4-b66a-ee96169c4931/image.png)
3. To have the real-time alerts on the liveblogposting posts for users want to subscribe to get latest news

  

Long shots

1. To look into Web Stories to increase visibility
